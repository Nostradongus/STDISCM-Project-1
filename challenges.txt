Challenges encountered so far from the project:
1) Extracting all possible urls from the DLSU website (all webpages)
- There are urls that lead to pdfs, pngs, etc. (e.g. /<file_name>.pdf) which should not be included
    - An algorithm should be implemented to avoid including these urls in the list
- Extracting urls takes a lot of time, and sometimes there are urls that are revisited more than once which should be avoided
    - An algorithm should be implemented to avoid revisiting already visited urls
